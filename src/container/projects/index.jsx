    title: 'Recipe Generator', 
    description: 'A Web Application created using Flask and Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2 (GPT-2), allowing users to input the data (ingredients) and receive recipes. \nUtilized the Hugging Face pipeline API to generate contextually relevant recipes based on user input. \nIntegrated Edamam API for displaying the recipes and GPT-2 for generating additional recipes. Also provided detailed recipes when given a specific dish name. \nEmployed the GPT-2 Tokenizer to preprocess the input data and convert it into a format suitable for the model. \nSuccessfully combined external API and NLP techniques into an application.',
